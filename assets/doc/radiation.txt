*Radiation* Plugin to add extra highlighting to certain file types where the static highlighting
Vim alone supplies is not enough.

1. Installiation                              *radiation-installation*

Radiation is currently only designed for Linux although Mac and BSD support will
be tested shortly, and may already work out of the box. To install radiation the
requrements are:

 * Vim 7.4+ with +python
 * libbsd
 * pthreads

In the future it may also become recommended to use a Vim server, but as of now 
there is no need for it.

Currently there is no support for Windows :-( because I am afraid to touch it, but
the project is hosted on Github where any help is appreciated!
